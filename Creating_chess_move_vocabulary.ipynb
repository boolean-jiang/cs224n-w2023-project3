Firstly, doing so would cause our vocabulary size to explode. Secondly, this information should be implicit in the move sequence comprising a whole game, and a Transformer model should be smart enough to learn how to handle this. An important consequence of this modeling decision is that the sequences of tokens by themselves will contain no information regarding the move number or player identity, so we will need to find a way of representing the games downstream to preserve this information if we decide to truncate games for training or use the model to evaluate the positions of games in the middle of play (i.e. not starting with White's first move). \n","* We will not append qualifiers used for human analysis to moves (e.g. `??` or `!`) for similar reasons as above. \n","* In many steps, we will \"overgenerate\" our vocabulary (i.e. create some move strings which do not correspond to legal moves or proper algebraic notation). While it's possible to create Python rules to ensure we only add legal, properly-notated moves to our final list, it's better and easier to add more strings to our vocabulary that do not ultimately get used (or will likely only appear in theoretical games/constructions, e.g. `Bd2e3`) to avoid having to use an `UNK` token whenever possible. As always, our final tokenizer will allow for `UNK` for edge cases such as corrupt PGN files with improper move strings. \n","* For similar reasons as above, we will use the non-standard `++` notation for double-checks and add them to our vocabulary. \n","\n","Later, we will also try building a vocabulary from a database of chess games, akin to how vocabularies are built from text corpora for natural language models. \n","\n","Let's begin!"],"metadata":{"id":"zQGNx0SBi0eN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Basic setup"],"metadata":{"id":"1-CEx2a3i0b_"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"vOmSX9ouf4Ca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1672356917969,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":1224,"user":{"displayName":"Bowen Jiang","userId":"16505810748545332074"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Very basic imports \n","import math, random\n","import sys, os\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import sklearn\n","import scipy\n","from glob import glob\n","from tqdm import tqdm"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set up some useful global objects\n","ALL_FILES = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']\n","ALL_RANKS = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']\n","CHECK = '+'\n","DOUBLECHECK = '++'\n","MATE = '#'\n","TAKES = 'x'"],"metadata":{"id":"GE-ECwNhgFwV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1672356917969,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Bowen Jiang","userId":"16505810748545332074"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Connect to Google Drive for writing files\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bj1iHrTBcksU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1672356941013,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":23047,"user":{"displayName":"Bowen Jiang","userId":"16505810748545332074"}},"outputId":"ed2cbb27-8e64-4c3c-a83d-84220436bc92"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Navigate to folder to read/write data\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/CS-224N_W2023_Final_Project/"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sjOGi4pCOcPP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1672356941014,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Bowen Jiang","userId":"16505810748545332074"}},"outputId":"05ed6ae8-1448-49ba-b19b-8b9a588cc99e"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/CS-224N_W2023_Final_Project\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Complete Vocabulary\n","\n","We begin by creating a complete vocabulary from first principles which will include every possible legal move expressible in algebraic notation.

As there can only be one king on the board for each color, we do not have to deal with disambiguation; additionally, the king cannot deliver double-checks (although, by moving out of the way of an allied piece, it can still \"deliver\" a discovered check or checkmate). Instead, we have to add a very tiny number of hard-coded move strings for castling, the king's special move.

However, many of these moves only occur in very rare or theoretical board positions and thus bloat the vocab size unnecessarily for normal game representation (it's almost at the limits of vocab sizes for most large language models - for example, the HuggingFace implementation of GPT has a vocab size of 40478, and GPT-2's is 50257). Therefore, we will make a smaller vocabulary using the above work as a starting point, with the following changes:\n","\n","* All pieces - double-checks will not be notated uniquely from regular (single) checks; the onus will be on downstream processing scripts to transform any differently-notated move strings to standard check notation. \n","* Knight - will only include qualifiers for rank OR file, not both at once (e.g. `Nbd2` or `N3e5`). This is sufficient for representing two knights for each player, which is the case for an exceeding majority of games (three or more knights on the board for one color will probably only arise in constructed positions or rare player disrespect/bad-mannering (BMing)). \n","* Bishop - no qualifiers. This is sufficient for representing moves where each player has a single light-squared/dark-square bishop, which again is the case for the vast majority of games excluding composed positions/BMing. \n","* Queen - will only include qualifiers for rank OR file, not both at once (e.g. `Qee5`or `Q2f2`). This is sufficient for representing two queens for each player, which can arise in rare situations/endgames (but three or more is very uncommon).
